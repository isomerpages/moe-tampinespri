Tampines West Community Club
============================

The school collaborates with Tampines West Community Club (TWCC) in various community activities. This collaboration platform gives our pupils opportunities to learn and contribute to the community. In 2014, Tampines Primary School and TWCC organised Malay and Indian Learning Journeys for all P1 and P2 pupils. The pupils learnt about the traditions and culture of Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali, they even tried their hands on several traditional games!
