Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)
===============================================

Tampines Primary School has been partnering Ministry of Social and Family Development (then known as MCYS) since 2006. Family Matters @ School adopts a holistic family learning model – equipping parents with effective parenting skills and training them to be parent facilitators and providing students with life skills training. We believe that a positive parent-child relationship is crucial in shaping the child’s character and values and the child would be better in coping with academic life.

  

In 2014, TPS collaborated with MSF to implement Triple P (Positive Parenting Programme). It is a parenting and family support programme that aims to prevent severe behavioural, emotional and developmental problems in children by enhancing the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents. It is one of the few parenting programmes in the world that has been scientifically proven to work and was found to be effective in reducing problem behaviour in children and improving parents’ wellbeing and parenting skills.
