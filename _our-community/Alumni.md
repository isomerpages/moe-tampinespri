Alumni@TPPS was officially launched in 2007. The alumni was formed to foster closer relationship and interaction among former pupils and staff of the school through social and recreational activities, promote a true spirit of loyalty and love for the alma mater so as to support the schoolâ€™s academic and co-curricular activities and to develop and promote fellowship amongst former pupils of the school. It comprises an executive committee of 8 members to plan and organise activities for ex-pupils as well as to provide support for school activities such as Chinese Dance CCA, field trips, Open House, Fathers@School event- My Daddy Rockz and VIA programmes.
