School Family Education (SFE)
=============================

The school embarked on the School Family Education (SFE) partnership from 2006. SFE adopts a holistic family learning model – equipping parents with effective parenting skills and training them to be parent facilitators, helping school staff to enhance their family life, and providing students with life skills training. We believe that a positive parent-child relationship is crucial in shaping the child’s character and values and the child would be better in coping with academic life. Tampines Primary School acknowledges that fathers also play an important parenting role and hence we initiated a “Fathers@Schools seminars for fathers across the 13 schools in East Cluster 6. During the session, fathers acquired valuable information from our 2 speakers, Mr Jason Wong, Senior Director (Ministry of Social and Family Development) and Mr Jim Bek, Counsellor from Greendale Secondary School.
