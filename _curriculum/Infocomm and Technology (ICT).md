<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>ICT Structured Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Tampines Primary School has a structured ICT programme for students from
Primary One to Primary Six. Students will pick up ICT skills in line with
MOE Baseline ICT Standards. The programme integrates ICT skills into the
mastering of core subjects such as English and Mother Tongue languages,
Mathematics and Art and Crafts. In addition, students work with different
ICT tools to develop different end products, and are evaluated at the end
of the course according to the rubrics created for each level.</p>
<p>The table below provides more details on the programme structure.</p>

<h4><strong>Maker Space</strong></h4>
<p>Maker Space develops in students a growth mindset (learning and creating
something out of nothing; exploration of own interest), craftsmanship (making),
open sharing (sharing) and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Maker Space sessions are conducted termly during lunch breaks.</p>
<p>Sessions will be conducted surrounding various themes. This will engage
students in building upon their knowledge learnt, reinforcing concepts,
and helping them see how they can apply such knowledge to create hands-on
objects. Through these sessions, we aim for students to learn to observe
phenomena and question processes, enabling them to further their critical
thinking skills by asking what, why, and how.</p>

<h3><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h4><strong>1. What is Cyber Wellness</strong></h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students
to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students
should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible
use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology
for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive
use of technology for the good of the community.</p>
<p>Mobile and Internet technologies are becoming increasingly pervasive in
our world.&nbsp; The open nature of the Internet poses a danger to our
students as it can expose them to undesirable content which can potentially
corrupt their value systems. Students today face new challenges with online
interactions. They need to be grounded on sound values and be equipped
with the skills to guard their values.</p>
