<b>Reading Mum &amp; Dad Programme</b> <br>
“The world belongs to those who read.” <br>
– Rick Holland

The programme is an initiative by the English Department in partnership with our Parent Volunteers (PV) to promote a love of reading among our P1 and P2 students. The weekly programme is helmed by the Learning Support Co-ordinators and dedicated PV to promote the joy of reading to selected students.&nbsp;

They guide each student one-on-one at their own pace with a variety of materials and a range of books provided by the department in their reading. It is a child-directed approach. The students in the programme enjoy these weekly sessions and look forward to meeting their ‘Aunties and Uncles’.&nbsp;

A picture paints a thousand words and so, let the following pictures capture some wonderful moments during the sessions.

<b>kidsREAD Club</b> <br>
It is a collaboration between the National Library Board (NLB) and our school to expose selected P1-P2 students to different book genres. We intend to inculcate in them the deep love for reading and hope that they carry on this habit for a lifetime. The students are involved in doing other interesting tasks that are found in their activity books provided by the NLB.&nbsp;To entice them, our very own PSG members also conduct craft activities that are related to the theme of the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our students are engaged in learning to read through Moo-O, an online programme. Moo-O excites our students as they see themselves become the story characters, participating in the story they are reading. They can learn independently the pronunciation of a word or how to read expressively from the reading model. With the playback feature and the help of rubrics, Moo-O provides our students with immediate feedback for self-assessment of performance. They can choose to rehearse and re-record in order to improve upon fluency, rhythm, pacing, intonation and expression. Just like how a professional presenter would have done it too.
