<b>Reading Mum & Dad Programme</b>

“The world belongs to those who read.”

– Rick Holland

The programme is an initiative by the English Department in partnership with our Parent Volunteers (PV) to promote a love of reading among our P1 and P2 students. The weekly programme is helmed by the Learning Support Co-ordinators and dedicated PV to promote the joy of reading to selected students. 

They guide each student one-on-one at their own pace with a variety of materials and a range of books provided by the department in their reading. It is a child-directed approach. The students in the programme enjoy these weekly sessions and look forward to meeting their ‘Aunties and Uncles’. 

A picture paints a thousand words and so, let the following pictures capture some wonderful moments during the sessions.
