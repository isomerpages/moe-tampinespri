Student Development Department
==============================

The Student Development Department takes care of the well-being and the holistic development of our students. We believe in inclusivity and we have programmes to cater to the different groups of students in our school. We also provide different leadership opportunities for all students as we believe that all our students can lead and serve.

  

Our school has rules and regulations in place to provide a conducive, safe and positive learning environment for our students. Discipline is an educative process and we aim to instill self-discipline and nurture good character in our students. A whole-school approach is used in promoting positive behaviour in our students through the teaching of values and skills as well as positive reinforcement and guidance to address studentsâ€™ inappropriate behaviour.
