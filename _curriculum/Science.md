Students in Tampines Primary School acquire scientific concepts through inquiry learning. Various strategies such as investigation, cooperative learning, problem-solving, drama, role-play, field trip and demonstration are employed using the 5E instructional model. Students experience the stages of Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate to discover their newly constructed knowledge and skills without forgetting the ethics and attitudes of a Young Scientist.

### **GO GREEN @ TPPS**

School-wide green initiatives for all students are conducted throughout the academic year. This is to heighten awareness on the importance of saving the Earth and to be a caring and concerned citizen for our environment. Level wide programmes, assembly talks as well as recess activities are carried out in school to educate our students on the steps they could follow to save the environment.


### **Experiential Learning - Science Field Trips**

Students are provided with learning experiences beyond the school to places such as Singapore Science Centre, Gardens by the Bay and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Science field trips serve as rich avenues that provide the authentic experiences for students to construct meaning from the concepts they have acquired in school and apply them during these field trips using the spirit of inquiry. After the trips, students carry on with research or activities to further deepen their understanding.
