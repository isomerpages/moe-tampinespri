Mathematics
===========

### **Vision**

A community of confident and effective problem solvers in mathematics  
  

### **Mission**

To equip students with mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills  
  

In Tampines Primary School (TPPS), the Mathematics Department works towards nurturing Young Mathematicians who actively play the role of thinkers and problem-solvers.

  

<u><b>Concrete Pictorial Abstract Experiential Approach</b></u>

  

Anchoring on TPPS Strategic Thrust 1: Achieving Academic Excellence and the MOE Mathematics Framework, our department uses the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract-Experiential (CPAE) approach to help students develop thinking, reasoning, communication, and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving. Through experiential learning, our students acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics.

  

Our teachers seek to bring enjoyment and excitement in the learning of mathematics through activity-based lessons, authentic learning tasks and innovative teaching strategies. They leverage on effective questioning to stimulate students’ critical thinking and analytical skills.
