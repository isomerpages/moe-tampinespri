Mathematics
===========

### **Vision**

A community of confident and effective problem solvers in mathematics  
  

### **Mission**

To equip students with mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills  
  

In Tampines Primary School (TPPS), the Mathematics Department works towards nurturing Young Mathematicians who actively play the role of thinkers and problem-solvers.

  

<u><b>Concrete Pictorial Abstract Experiential Approach</b></u>

  

Anchoring on TPPS Strategic Thrust 1: Achieving Academic Excellence and the MOE Mathematics Framework, our department uses the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract-Experiential (CPAE) approach to help students develop thinking, reasoning, communication, and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving. Through experiential learning, our students acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics.

  

Our teachers seek to bring enjoyment and excitement in the learning of mathematics through activity-based lessons, authentic learning tasks and innovative teaching strategies. They leverage on effective questioning to stimulate students’ critical thinking and analytical skills.

### **Key Programmes**

<b>Learning Support for Mathematics</b>

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) provides early intervention for Primary 1 and 2 students with weak numeracy skills by trained LSM teachers in small group settings. The programme aims to build students’’ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to learn mathematics.

  

<b>Talent Development Programme</b>

Mathematics Olympiad Training is provided for high progress learners in Primary 5 and 6 to equip them with a repertoire of problem-solving techniques to solve higher-order and non-routine problems. This enables our students to hone their skills at competitions such as the National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) and Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary School (SMOPS).

<b>Math Game Hot Hour</b>

Math Game Hot Hour is conducted once a week during recess to instill the love for mathematics through games and fun-filled activities.

  

<b>Integrated Trails</b>

Together with the English and Science Departments, integrated trails are organised to help create the awareness that mathematics is all around us and we make use of mathematics in our everyday life.

### **Math Olympiad Competitions Semester 1**

In Semester 1, a group of P5 and P6 students had participated in two Math Olympiad Competitions, namely, the&nbsp;Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC) 2022 and Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary School (APMOPS) 2022.

The aim of the Math Olympiad Competitions is to generate greater interest in Mathematics among students in primary schools. It is also an opportunity for them to identify and explore their talents in Mathematics.

Congratulations to these students who achieved the following awards!
