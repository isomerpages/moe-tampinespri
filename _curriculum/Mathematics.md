<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Develop students to be confident &amp; effective problem solvers in Mathematics</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To equip students with mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills</p>
<p>In Tampines Primary School (TPPS), the Mathematics Department works towards
nurturing Young Mathematicians who actively play the role of thinkers and
problem-solvers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Concrete Pictorial Abstract Experiential Approach</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Guided by the MOE Mathematics Framework, our department adopts the Concrete–Pictorial–Abstract–Experiential
(CPAE) approach to help students develop strong thinking, reasoning, communication,
and metacognitive skills through a problem-solving lens.</p>
<p>Through rich experiential learning opportunities, students build deep
understanding of mathematical concepts and acquire skills for everyday
application and lifelong learning in mathematics.</p>
<p>To cater to the varied learning needs of our students, teachers employ
Differentiated Instruction (DI) and intentionally develop 21st Century
Competencies (E21CC) within the mathematics classroom. We further enhance
learning by leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools
to deepen conceptual understanding, promote active participation, and support
self-directed learning.</p>
<p>Our teachers strive to cultivate joyful and engaging mathematics experiences
through activity based lessons and authentic tasks. Purposeful and effective
questioning is used to stimulate students’ critical and analytical thinking,
nurturing confident and reflective learners of mathematics.</p>

<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) provides early intervention for
Primary 1 to 4 students with weak numeracy skills by trained LSM teachers
in small group settings. The programme aims to build students’ confidence
and positive beliefs about their ability to learn mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence 2000 Mathematics (E2K) &amp; Math Olympiad Training</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics and Olympiad Training are provided for high progress
learners in Primary 4 to 6 to equip them with a repertoire of problem-solving
techniques to solve higher-order and non-routine problems. It aims to aims
to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual
understanding through an inquiry approach. This also enables our students
to hone their skills at competitions such as the National Mathematical
Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) and Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary
School (SMOPS).</p>
<p><strong>Math School Based Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school-based Mathematics activities are designed to infuse joy and
excitement into learning by giving students the opportunities to explore
math beyond the classroom. Through level-wide competitions, students challenge
themselves with number puzzles and problem solving tasks that strengthen
logical reasoning and nurture a healthy sense of competition. The Math
Trail around the school further deepens experiential learning, as students
apply mathematical concepts in authentic, real world contexts while working
collaboratively with their peers. These varied experiences not only make
mathematics fun and meaningful but also help our students build confidence,
curiosity and a positive disposition towards the subject.</p>
