### **Vision**


A gracious individual who is aesthetically literate and appreciates the Arts  
  

### **Mission**

Provide a structured curriculum to cultivate interest and ignite passion for the Arts in students  
  

### **Overview**

Art plays an important role in the students’ growth and development. In Tampines Primary School, students develop visual inquiry skills to discover and explore their surroundings through a structured art curriculum, They will learn to share their ideas, thoughts and feelings through their artworks and acquire skills that enable them to describe and interpret artworks using suitable art vocabulary. Through art making, students will cultivate a spirit of innovation and experimentation. They will be exposed to a variety of 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional art forms, art materials and art techniques. They will learn from a range of artworks by Singapore and international artists as well as student artists from primary schools.

  

Leveraging the school environment as a learning tool, our students have art appreciation lessons at the school’s art gallery and other art display areas in the school. During recess time, there is also the Art@Recess programme to further expose students to different art forms, materials and techniques. The Primary four students also get to experience Museum-Based Learning at the National Gallery, Singapore to learn more about the artworks in the museum.

  

### **Primary Four Digital Art Programme**

The Primary four students were exposed to Digital Art this year. They learnt how to create a digital landscape in impressionist style using the Wacom tablet and ArtRage software.
