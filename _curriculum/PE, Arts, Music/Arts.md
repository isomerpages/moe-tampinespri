<h1>Art</h1>
<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Adaptable learners who appreciate the Arts and express thoughts, feelings,
and ideas through creating and responding to art.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Provide a structured art curriculum that develops students’ artistic skills
and adaptive creative thinking through making, responding, and reflecting.</p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Art plays an important role in students’ growth and development. In Tampines
Primary School, students develop visual inquiry skills to observe, explore
and make sense of the world through a structured art curriculum.</p>
<p>They learn to communicate ideas, thoughts and feelings through their artworks,
and build the skills to describe and interpret artworks using appropriate
art vocabulary. Through art-making, students cultivate creativity, adaptability,
and a spirit of innovation and experimentation. They are exposed to a range
of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional art forms, materials and techniques,
and learn from artworks by Singapore and international artists, as well
as student artists from primary schools.</p>
<p>Primary 4 students also experience Museum-Based Learning at the National
Gallery, Singapore to deepen their understanding and appreciation of art.
Students’ artworks are showcased during our Aesthetics Fest, where they
also take part in art experiences and activities that spark interest and
build a lasting appreciation for the Arts.</p>
