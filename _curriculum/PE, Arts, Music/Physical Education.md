<h3><strong>SPORTS EDUCATION MODEL APPROACH WITHIN</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>THE INTER-CLASS GAMES LEAGUE</strong></h4>
<p>Our Inter-Class Games league during recess is designed using the Sports
Education Model approach where students experience sports beyond just playing.
Across the league season, students take on authentic roles such as players,
referees and scorers. It provides students with an opportunity to engage
in friendly competition, promote physical activity, and foster a sense
of teamwork and school spirit. It is an authentic platform for students
to apply their PE skills, socio-emotional competencies and adaptive thinking
ability as team-mates collaborate to strategize against opposing teams,
creating a meaningful and inclusive sporting experience for all.</p>
