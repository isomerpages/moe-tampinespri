Education Model approach where students experience sports beyond just playing.

referees and scorers. It provides students with an opportunity to engage
in friendly competition, promote physical activity, and foster a sense
of teamwork and school spirit. It is an authentic platform for students
to apply their PE skills, socio-emotional competencies and adaptive thinking
ability as team-mates collaborate to strategize against opposing teams,
