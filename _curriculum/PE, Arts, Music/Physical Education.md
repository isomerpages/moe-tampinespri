Physical Education in Tampines Primary School is integral to the all-round development of our students. Psychomotor skills are taught in tandem with cognitive understanding based on age-appropriate sports science principles.

Innovative initiatives leveraging technology collaborative practice, such as our Video Analysis &amp; Critique of Sport Skills and P6 Sport Education - provide authentic contexts and experiences as the foundation to equip our students with skills competencies for the future.
