Physical Education
==================

### **Vision**

A healthy and active individual who contributes positively to the community  
  

### **Mission**

To nurture students who have the right attitude and aptitude for sports and healthy living  

Physical Education in Tampines Primary School is integral to the all-round development of our students. Psychomotor skills are taught in tandem with cognitive understanding based on age-appropriate sports science principles. Underpinning the physical education experience is an emphasis on values inculcation and character building – which provides a conducive environment for our students to have fun to learn with and from one another.

  

The curriculum comprises of Athletics, Dance, Games & Sports, Gymnastics, Physical Health & Fitness and Swimming. Innovative initiatives leveraging technology collaborative practice, such as our Video Analysis & Critique of Sport Skills and P6 Sport Education - provide authentic contexts and experiences as the foundation to equip our students with skills competencies for the future.
