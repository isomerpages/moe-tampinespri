Innovation and Enterprise
=========================

Tampines Primary School recognizes the role of Innovation and Enterprise (I&E) in challenging the mindsets of teachers and students in the changing education landscape. The revised Desired Outcomes of Education (Curriculum 2015 student outcomes) and 21st Century Skills reinforce the need to leverage I&E to provide a holistic education for our students. The school has in place programmes to nurture creativity and enterprise in students.

  

### **Interdisciplinary Project Work**

Project Work provides students and teachers with opportunities to break away from the compartmentalization of knowledge and skills. Broad themes, which cut across subjects, are used to bring the various aspects of the curriculum together. Project work helps students see the interconnectedness of their learning. Students are encouraged to use resources, to work collaboratively, to think critically, creatively and independently and to communicate their findings.

<b>Framework & Rationale for Project Work</b>

Project Work in Tampines Primary School aims to provide a platform, undergird by values, for students to progressively apply knowledge and skills in authentic learning contexts. Using the TPPS PW Protocol (adapted from Design Thinking) as our innovative approach, we wish to develop students who are self-directed learners, effective communicators and creative problem solvers with a focus on the four project work outcomes.

  

In Tampines Primary School, project work is designed based on the TPPS PW Protocol, which is adapted from the four phases of Design for Change and Design Thinking.
