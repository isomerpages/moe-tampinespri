Applied Learning Programme (Drama) 
===================================

### **Overview**

Tampines Primary School (TPPS) achieved the niche status for Drama as a school-based curriculum in 2013.  
  

Drama as Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Tampines Primary is also known as STAR ACTtituDE. It stands for students with <b>S</b>trengths, <b>T</b>alents, <b>A</b>spiration and <b>R</b>esilience to achieve <b>A C</b>reative and <b>C</b>onfident <b>T</b>eamplayer with <b>T</b>ransformation <b>i</b>nspired <b>t</b>hrough <b>D</b>rama in <b>E</b>ducation  
  

Drama as ALP in Tampines Primary looks at developing creative, adaptable and confident Tampinesians. With drama exposure in the classroom and beyond, students experience a love of language and the art form through creative play and stimulation of the imagination. It is hoped that the students will graduate with confidence in creating, performing and responding, using drama as a learning tool.   
  

Based on the new EL Syllabus 2020, the learners’ outcomes and values match the intent and rationale of a Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Drama as a pedagogical approach extends from Primary 1 to Primary 6. The drama strategies are embedded in EL lessons to deepen learning in context. The drama lessons follow the <b>C</b>reate, <b>P</b>erform and <b>R</b>espond approach in learning.  
  

Drama is a significant vehicle for language learning. The emphasis is for drama to bring out confident speakers and empathetic communicators. It provides a platform for exploring people-related issues through a powerful mode of expression. Drama as pedagogy also enables our learners to better hone their social and emotional competencies and to encourage self-expression. The school is exploring ways to increase opportunities for students to create and perform their own productions and presentations. These platforms can be seen as multimodal forms of expression for students to increase confidence. Drama as pedagogy is also a vehicle to develop creative inquirers and discerning readers.

### **Background**

In 1997, Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced “Thinking Schools,Learning Nation” (TSLN) an initiative which provides direction to the transformation in the education system in recent years. “Teach Less, Learn More” (TLLM) builds on the groundwork laid in place by the improvements made under the TSLN vision. TLLM continues the TSLN journey by focusing on improving the quality of interaction between teachers and learners, so that our learners can be more engaged in learning. TLLM is about shifting the focus from “quantity” to “quality” in education. TLLM aims to improve the quality of teaching and learning. It is about teaching better, to touch the hearts and engage the minds of our learners and prepare them for life, rather than teaching more, for tests and examinations.  
  

### **Drama Beyond the Classroom**
--------------------------

#### **Community Theatre**

The collaborative theatre making process is a platform for building rapport and creativity in students, alumni, parents and teachers. Every year, drama CCA also known as Theatrics in Action creates theatre, revolving around social issues to raise awareness. Our first community theatre installation was in 2012 where we collaborated with Ageless Theatre, a senior citizens theatre group with the theme “Heart Strings, Heart Family.”   

  

#### **Forum Theatre**

‘What if?’ is a platform for Forum Theatre which is held during assembly period. Forum Theatre is used as a vehicle for learning and thinking about issues. Students explore different perspectives and are empowered to make a change. The audience are able to participate and react to situations that are applicable to real life situations.
