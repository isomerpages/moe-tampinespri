Applied Learning Programme (Drama) 
===================================

### **Overview**

Tampines Primary School (TPPS) achieved the niche status for Drama as a school-based curriculum in 2013.  
  

Drama as Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Tampines Primary is also known as STAR ACTtituDE. It stands for students with <b>S</b>trengths, <b>T</b>alents, <b>A</b>spiration and <b>R</b>esilience to achieve <b>A C</b>reative and <b>C</b>onfident <b>T</b>eamplayer with <b>T</b>ransformation <b>i</b>nspired <b>t</b>hrough <b>D</b>rama in <b>E</b>ducation  
  

Drama as ALP in Tampines Primary looks at developing creative, adaptable and confident Tampinesians. With drama exposure in the classroom and beyond, students experience a love of language and the art form through creative play and stimulation of the imagination. It is hoped that the students will graduate with confidence in creating, performing and responding, using drama as a learning tool.   
  

Based on the new EL Syllabus 2020, the learners’ outcomes and values match the intent and rationale of a Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Drama as a pedagogical approach extends from Primary 1 to Primary 6. The drama strategies are embedded in EL lessons to deepen learning in context. The drama lessons follow the <b>C</b>reate, <b>P</b>erform and <b>R</b>espond approach in learning.  
  

Drama is a significant vehicle for language learning. The emphasis is for drama to bring out confident speakers and empathetic communicators. It provides a platform for exploring people-related issues through a powerful mode of expression. Drama as pedagogy also enables our learners to better hone their social and emotional competencies and to encourage self-expression. The school is exploring ways to increase opportunities for students to create and perform their own productions and presentations. These platforms can be seen as multimodal forms of expression for students to increase confidence. Drama as pedagogy is also a vehicle to develop creative inquirers and discerning readers.
