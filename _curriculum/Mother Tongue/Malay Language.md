### **Language Competitions**

We organize and strongly encourage our students to participate in language competition, be it internally or organized by external bodies. The rationale is to provide students with a more authenticate experience of applying their language knowledge.

### **Holistic Assessment**

P1 and P2 Portfolio Assessment initiatives give our students opportunities to indulge in self-directed learning, where they become active contributors in their own learning. They are involved in critical analysis of their own language learning and development. Team spirit is also inculcated and developed. Supplementary lessons are conducted with aims to provide students with supplementary and additional academic assistance on language learning, beyond school hours.
