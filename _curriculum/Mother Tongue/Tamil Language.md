#### READING PROGRAMMES
Reading is crucial in any language learning. It exposes students to sentences, grammar, and vocabulary. A child who reads extensively is also an independent and self-directed learner. As such, our MT department implements various reading programmes in school to promote reading.
* Story-telling using ICT tools
* MT story book reading at Hall on Wednesday
* PSG Reading Mum Classroom reading activity
