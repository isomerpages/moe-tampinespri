Tamil Language
==============

The TPS Tamil Department aims to nurture students’ love for Tamil Language by adopting varied Teaching Strategies. students are exposed to songs, listening to stories and many different language games. Role plays, Story Telling and Show-and-Tell are some strategies used effectively to arouse the students’ interest and engage them in learning the language.

“I Love Reading” is a strategy that is used to encourage students to read Tamil Stories and develop their language. students plan and organize role plays and quizzes for their fellow friends to motivate them to read. students are also given opportunities to present during the Mother Tongue Early Bird Session on Wednesdays, which is conducted for all the Tamil students in the school. This platform gives students confidence to address a large audience in Tamil language.

The teachers also designed their own Oral and Composition packages to further aid students in their development in language. Listening Comprehension package is also designed to further equip students in language skills. students are exposed to SAIL and Mind Mapping tools to aid them in self-directed learning. students have created their own blogs and contribute articles to both Tamil Murasu and the E6 Cluster Magazine. The students are also provided opportunities to collaborate with students in the cluster through the various cluster activities, like Language Activity Day etc.
