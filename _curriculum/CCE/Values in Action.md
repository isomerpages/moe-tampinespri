Values in Action
================

<u><b>Values in Action (VIA)</b></u>

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. 

As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully. This is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education.

<u><b>School goals</b></u>

To develop in students and staff

• A strong sense of commitment to serve the school and community;

• A sense of responsibility to the environment; 

•   Spirit of volunteerism; so that they exhibit the traits of Hallmark of Tampinesian student and staff.
