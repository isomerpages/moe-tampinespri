### **Overview**

The Singapore Social Studies Curriculum is geared towards the preparation of students to be citizens of tomorrow. It aims to help them better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives.  Students are exposed to aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to them. Through inquiry-based learning, coupled with authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to have better knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.

### **Field-based learning**

  

Through field-based learning, students contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting.  It would also motivate and sustain their interest in the subject matter as students learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topics.  This enables the learning of concepts and content. Students would be engaged in multi-sensory learning when they do hands-on exploration in a focused area of study.
