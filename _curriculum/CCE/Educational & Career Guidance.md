Educational & Career Guidance
=============================

<b>EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)</b>

ECG is about equipping students with the ability to acquire knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work. 

In TPPS, we aim to develop students’ awareness on career interests, strengths in DSA and explore educational pathways throughout their primary school experience. 

<u><b>Career Talk for Primary 1 & 2</b></u>

Career Talk Sessions are conducted during lessons for the Prep School students with guest speakers from alumni and parents. They share about the nature of their work and challenges they faced. Through the career talks, Primary 1 & 2 students gain a better understanding on the different careers available and scope of work in the hope to excite and motivate students in their learning.

<u><b>Direct School Admission (DSA) Talk for Primary 3 & 4</b></u>

SLS lessons are created by the ECG team to provide students with an opportunity to have a better understanding of the DSA programme and the CCAs available. Students watch videos and listen to the experiences of former students who have been successful in their application through DSA. At the end of the lesson, students gain more awareness of the opportunities available through DSA and to also make informed choices about their CCA selection at Primary 3 and 4.

<u><b>MySkillsFuture Portal for Primary 5 & Primary 6 students</b></u>

The MyskillsFuture student portal allows students to learn about key features that enable them to explore the different education options and schools available. This portal is designed to raise their awareness and plan their educational pathways so that they can embark on the next level of their education as they transit to secondary schools.
