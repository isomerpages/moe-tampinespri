<h1>Educational &amp; Career Guidance</h1>
<p><strong>EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>ECG is about equipping students with the ability to acquire knowledge,
skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage
for successful transition from school to further education or work.</p>
<p>In TPPS, we aim to develop students’ awareness on career interests, strengths
in Direct School Admission (DSA) and explore educational pathways throughout
their primary school experience.</p>

</p>
<p>Career Talk Sessions are conducted during lessons for the Prep School
students with guest speakers from alumni and parents. They share about
the nature of their work and challenges they faced. Through the career
talks, Primary 1 &amp; 2 students gain a better understanding on the different
careers available and scope of work in the hope to excite and motivate
students in their learning.</p>

<p><strong><u>Direct School Admission (DSA) Talk for Primary 3 &amp; 4</u></strong>
</p>
<p>SLS lessons are created by the ECG team to provide students with an opportunity
to have a better understanding of the DSA programme and the CCAs available.
Students watch videos and listen to the experiences of former students
who have been successful in their application through DSA. At the end of
the lesson, students gain more awareness of the opportunities available
through DSA and to also make informed choices about their CCA selection
at Primary 3 and 4.</p>

<p><strong><u>MySkillsFuture Portal for Primary 5 &amp; Primary 6 students</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The MyskillsFuture student portal allows students to learn about key features
that enable them to explore the different education options and schools
available. This portal is designed to raise their awareness and plan their
educational pathways so that they can embark on the next level of their
education as they transit to secondary schools.</p>
