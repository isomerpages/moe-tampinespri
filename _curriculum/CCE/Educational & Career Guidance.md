Educational & Career Guidance
=============================

<b>EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)</b>

ECG is about equipping students with the ability to acquire knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work. 

In TPPS, we aim to develop students’ awareness on career interests, strengths in DSA and explore educational pathways throughout their primary school experience. 

<u><b>Career Talk for Primary 1 & 2</b></u>

Career Talk Sessions are conducted during lessons for the Prep School students with guest speakers from alumni and parents. They share about the nature of their work and challenges they faced. Through the career talks, Primary 1 & 2 students gain a better understanding on the different careers available and scope of work in the hope to excite and motivate students in their learning.
