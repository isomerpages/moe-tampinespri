<h1>Educational &amp; Career Guidance</h1>
<p><strong>EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>ECG is about equipping students with the ability to acquire knowledge,
skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage
for successful transition from school to further education or work.</p>
<p>In TPPS, we aim to develop students’ awareness on career interests, strengths
in Direct School Admission (DSA) and explore educational pathways throughout
their primary school experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>MySkillsFuture Portal for Primary 5 &amp; Primary 6 students</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Career Talk Sessions are conducted during lessons for the Prep School
students with guest speakers from alumni and parents. They share about
the nature of their work and challenges they faced. Through the career
talks, Primary 1 &amp; 2 students gain a better understanding on the different
careers available and scope of work in the hope to excite and motivate
students in their learning.</p>
