CCE Awards &amp; Recognition
========================

<b>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) awards</b>

In our school, we hope that students can grow to be&nbsp;self-disciplined, self-motivated, caring, confident, creative, adaptable, happy and healthy.&nbsp;The following awards support our efforts in nurturing students of good and strong values and character through affirming them.

<b>Caught Doing Right award</b>

The Caught Doing Right (CDR) award aims at affirming students who exhibit commendable behaviour and actions as they go about their daily school life.&nbsp;

<b>Home Education award</b>

Through the Home Education award, we partner with families in the education of our students to become individuals who are self-directed learners of good character. Family members of students are given the opportunity to share with the school positive traits demonstrated by the children at home. Besides affirming the students and reinforcing CCE at home, the insights provided by the family helps the school to better understand and nurture our students in their character development.

<b>Model Pupil award</b>

Every term, the school recognizes and affirms model pupils who display exemplary character and conduct based on our schoolâ€™s core values of Integrity, Resilience, Excellence, Adaptability and Passion. It is our hope that these students would then embrace the good work that they have done and serve as role models in supporting and inspiring their friends and classmates towards character growth.
