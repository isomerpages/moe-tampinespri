Learning for Life Programme
===========================


### **Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – The Community Leader**
--------------------------------------------------------

  

In Tampines Primary School, we are committed to nurturing Confident and Caring Leaders who are of service to community and society. 

Our LLP is predicated on the key principles of servant leadership and weaves in Design Thinking framework to develop creative thinking ability in our students.  Undergirded by the three key CCE concepts (i.e. Identity, Relationships, Choices), our curriculum takes on an experiential and authentic learning approach to develop student voice and ownership, empathy, and future-readiness in our students. 

We leveraged of our strong partnerships as the first community school, to greatly enrich the learning experiences of our students. 

The social and emotional competencies, values, and 21CC learnt from our Form Teacher Guidance Periods and Assembly Programme, as well as various learning opportunities, will be put into action in our daily school life and culminate in thematic VIA & School based projects for each level and CCA.

### **Overview of  our TPPS LLP Experience**

We believe that “Every Tampinesian can lead and serve”. Aligned to our School core values iREAP and the Hallmarks of a Tampinesian, our student leadership framework is built on the different spheres of influence that ensures students are given different scopes of development based on their needs and skills acquisition.
