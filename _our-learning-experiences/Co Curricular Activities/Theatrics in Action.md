<h1>Theatrics in Action</h1>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture and develop every Theatrics in Action member into a confident
and creative inquirer who is collaborative and socially responsible in
the community.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop creativity through student agency and empower students to advocate
good values with confidence through drama</p>
<h4><strong>Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Empowerment through play&nbsp;and theatre</p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Drama in TPPS aims to develop creative, adaptable and confident Tampinesians.
Through exposure to&nbsp;creative play and stimulation of imagination in
and beyond the classroom, students experience the love&nbsp;for the art
form. Drama Club also known as Theatrics in Action provides a platform
in developing our&nbsp;drama talents.</p>
<p>Our signature annual play production is Community Theatre. Community Theatre
focuses on themes&nbsp;to raise awareness on social and global issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Community Theatre, the school aims to build community bonds through
the theatre&nbsp;experience. It is an exciting platform for students and
teachers to devise theatre. In Community&nbsp;Theatre, students and teachers
are involved in the playbuilding process in which they devise and perform
a play. We are also privileged to have a performance space which we share
with the&nbsp;community - “The Blackbox Theatre”. Our wish in Theatrics
in Action is to build a strong nexus for our&nbsp;students, educators and
the community to bond and learn more about humanity through a common&nbsp;theatre
experience.</p>
