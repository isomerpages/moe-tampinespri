Scouts
======

#### **Vision**

CCE through the Scout promise and scout law  
  

#### **Mission**

To nurture altruistic leadership through outdoor play  

### **Overview**

Learning is by doing. Tampines Cub Scouts explore nature through exciting outdoor activities. We go for hikes, we prepare our own meals, we build shelters, we spread love and bring smiles to the people around us. We develop Sixers to explore their areas of interest and transfer their learning to their juniors. A Scout has courage in all difficulties. Learning is by doing.
