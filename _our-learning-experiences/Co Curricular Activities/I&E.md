I&E club allows the students to develop the much required 21st Century skills, social and emotional competencies through two main prongs. The first being an entrepreneur where the students come up with products to sell to their peers and teachers. The second being a change maker as they empathize with a social problem and believe that they are empowered to make a difference.

  

The students are given the opportunity to be change makers and problem solvers through the FIDS framework (adapted from Design for change - DFC). The 4 step FIDS (Feel, Imagine, Do and Share) process leads students to understand situations empathetically, think about possible solutions and put them into action. With this as an anchor, the students work towards participating in the annual DFC Singapore Challenge. Design for Change Singapore Challenge is one of Singapore’s largest Inter-School Challenges recognising young change makers and their meaningful work. Schools will submit their projects which are evaluated by an expert panel of judges to determine the winners. With this, students look forward to being part of the annual ‘Be the Change’ Celebration where they will celebrate and share the inspiring work of one another. At this platform, not only do they share what they have done, but also learn from the students of other schools on the projects that they have embarked on. It is a truly unique learning experience for them.
