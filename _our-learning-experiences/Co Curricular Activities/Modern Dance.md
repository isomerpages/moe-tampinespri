Modern Dance
============

#### Vision

Confident and disciplined dancers with a passion for dance, culture and the performing arts  

#### Overview

Modern Dance is a form of art beyond its aesthetic value. The CCA believes in nurturing students to their fullest potential, providing opportunities for both talent and character development. Through learning modern and traditional dance, they acquire skills such as flexibility, poise, musicality and a heightened sense of aesthetic dance movement. Dancers develop resilience and excellence, as well as an appreciation for culture and the performing arts. Training sessions will begin with fundamental dance techniques and gradually progress to advanced choreography. The CCA prepares dancers for competitions like the prestigious SYF Arts Presentation.
