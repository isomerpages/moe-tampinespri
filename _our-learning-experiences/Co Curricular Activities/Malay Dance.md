Malay Dance
===========

#### Vision

  
To be individuals who exude resilience and commitment in dance  

### Overview

Malay Dance CCA provides our Malay dancers with the opportunity to learn the 5 different genres of Malay traditional dance; Asli, Inang, Joget, Zapin and Masri. They are given various platforms via school events, external performances and competitions for the pupils to showcase their talents.Â 

  

The various performances create opportunities for the students to develop character, values and to discover their interests and talents. Through participation in dance as a CCA, it is hoped that students develop leadership skills and acquire positive values like resilience, self-discipline and commitment.

  

In Malay Dance CCA, apart from presenting opportunities for students at various platforms, students will also be able to improve on their relationship management while learning to work together as a team towards a common goal.
