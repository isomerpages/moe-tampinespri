They are given various platforms via school events, external performances and competitions for the pupils to showcase their talents.&nbsp;</p><p>The various performances create opportunities for the students to develop character, values and to discover their interests and talents. Through participation in dance as a CCA, it is hoped that students develop leadership skills and acquire positive values like resilience, self-discipline and commitment.</p><p>In Malay Dance CCA, apart from presenting opportunities for students at various platforms, students will also be able to improve on their relationship management while learning to work together as a team towards a common goal.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day &amp; Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers-in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Levels involved</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Friday<br>8.00am - 9.30am<br><br>Monday and Thursday (if needed for SYF Prep)<br>3.30pm - 5.30pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Dance Room<br>(MK building)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Norleila Ramadan (I/C)<br>Mdm Nur Liyana Binte Abdul Ghani (2I/C)<br>Miss Jolyn Ngo (Prep) (PM)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>P3 - P6 students</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Year</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Competition</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Achievement</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2022</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Hari Raya Dance Performance (school)<br>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Hari Raya Dance Performance(school) via online</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Tampines West CC (22nd June) Hari Raya Dinner Dance Showcase <br>MUARA Festival<br>Hari Raya Dance Performance (school)<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2018</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation Muara <br>North East Community Give-Back Golf &amp; Appreciation Dinner <br>Tampines Park RC<br>Hari Raya Showcase Tampines West CC<br>Malay Learning Journey Dance Showcase <br>Hari Raya Dance Performance (school)<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>SYF Certificate of Distinction<br><br></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2017</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Gardens By The Bay (19th May 2017)<br>Muara (4th Nov)<br>Tampines West CC (9th Nov)<br>Excellence Day (17th Nov)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Hari Raya Concert 2017 (Sch)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MalayDance.gif"></div><p></p>
