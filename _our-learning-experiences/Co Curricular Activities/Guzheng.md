It started with barely 10 students 10 years ago and has grown to about 40 students currently. Our Guzheng Ensemble is the only instrumental CCA in the school so far. Your child can acquire musical knowledge and skills that are beyond the curriculum for free. Being part of our Guzheng Ensemble enables your child to learn a new instrument and to get to know more about the Chinese culture. There will also be internal and external performances which includes the Singapore Arts Festival presentation (SYF AP) for your child to gain experience and exposure. We have a very conducive air- conditioned room for our practices. Even though Guzheng is a Chinese traditional instrument, our Guzheng Ensemble is open to all races and both genders. In fact we have a mixture of boys and girls from different races in our Guzheng Ensemble. Many of our ex-pupils have successfully got into the secondary school they desired and got into the Guzheng Ensemble or even Chinese Orchestra through DSA and till date they are still pursuing their interest in Guzheng. Our Guzheng Ensemble welcomes your child and we look forward to see your child in the near future.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Day &amp; Time</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers-in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Levels involved</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Friday<br>8.00am - 9.30am<br><br>Monday and Thursday (if needed for SYF Prep)<br>3.30pm - 5.30pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Band Room (MK Building)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Miss Zhu Li (i/c)<br>Miss Isabella Lai (2i/c)<br>Mdm Ni Jieren<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Pri 3 - Pri 6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Year</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Competition</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Achievement</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2022</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TBC</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2018</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Accomplishment</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Guzheng1.gif"></div><p></p>
