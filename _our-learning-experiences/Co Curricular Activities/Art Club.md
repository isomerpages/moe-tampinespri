Art Club
========

  

#### **Vision**

A creative and artistic individual who appreciates the Arts  
  

### **Overview**

Art Club members are exposed to a variety of art forms and mediums during the CCA. They are given opportunities to explore and experiment with different mediums during the art making process. Every year, pupils will also visit one of the museums in Singapore and engage in museum-based learning activities at the museum. Selected pupils will also be invited to participate in art competitions/art exhibitions/art camps.
