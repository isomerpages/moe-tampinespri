    <td class="tg-kk00">On 17 Oct 2022, 2 teachers went with 9 of our P6 students to our familiar Tampines Bus Interchange to lend support to <span style="color:black">SBS Transit Roadshow - Bus Safety Campaign @ Tampines Bus Interchange. We were there from 11 am to 1 pm. Our enthusiastic students were there to be SBS safety ambassadors to spread the message to the public on how to travel safely on public buses – ‘No Falls On Board’. Our students gave out pamphlets and packets of tissue paper while bringing across the message to the general public, especially to pregnant ladies, the elderly and people with mobility difficulties. Our students were also at quiz stations to ask participants simple questions to raise public awareness of travelling safe on board buses. It was an authentic and enriching VIA learning experience for our students. We wrapped up the valuable hands-on experience with a photo with the MP, Mr Desmond Choo, who had a short chat with our students too.</span></td>
