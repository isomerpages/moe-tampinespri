Our Malay dancers showcased their skills and talents through a traditional pre-recorded dance performance. To promote understanding and appreciation of the festival, our students learn about the spread of food served during Hari Raya besides watching photos and videos of their teachers and school leaders celebrating Hari Raya with their loved ones. The event was brought to a close by a sing along session to get the audience to be a part of the celebration.</span></td>
