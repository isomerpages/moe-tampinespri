We mark Total Defence Day on 15 February every year as a reminder of what could happen to us if we cannot defend Singapore ourselves, and to strengthen our resolve to keep Singapore safe, secure, and sovereign.The theme “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” is maintained to encourage students to play a greater role in Total Defence and to highlight the different ways they can contribute. Through the commemoration of Total Defence Day, we hope to rally and mobilise Singaporeans to prepare for future threats and challenges, and show resilience when crises strike. The COVID-19 experience has heightened the importance and relevance of Total Defence. When Singaporeans play their part, we will emerge stronger even as we battle the virus.</td>
