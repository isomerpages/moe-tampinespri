The Children’s Day celebrations at TPPS returned with a bang on Thursday, 6 October 2022, after a hiatus of two years.  Students were treated to a day of fun and games, starting with the P3 to P6 Senior Olympics organised by the PE Department. With the opportunity to participate in inter-class games like Captain’s Ball and football, as well as track and field events like the sprint and endurance relays and javelin throw, students had a blast playing to their hearts’ content and displaying the values of teamwork and sportsmanship. The classes, 3 Love, 4 Care, 5 Joy and 6 Joy, who emerged as respective Level Champions, were over the moon as their monitors came up on stage to receive the championship trophies. As for our Preparatory School, a slew of station games and bonding activities were also planned and run for them by our very own Parent Support Group (PSG). Their form teachers attested to the squeals of excitement and high levels of energy and enthusiasm shown by our young charges, and suffice to say that the games were well-received and was deemed a great success by both teachers and students alike.

After a morning of physical activities, students returned to their classrooms where under the guidance of their Form Teachers, they participated in the Children’s Day Appeal (CDA) by Community Chest, as well as the Celebrating Our Grands Campaign by MSF.  Through these activities, students learnt to show compassion and support for those who are in need, as well as appreciation and gratitude for family members who have played a key role in nurturing them. Also, students got to know their teachers better through the Guess The Teacher Mini-Me Edition Quiz, where they took a sneak peek at their teachers’ childhood photos, and gleefully and collaboratively tried to guess their identities. 

Last but not least, the celebrations culminated in the celebratory concert, where our very own teachers from the various schools showcased their varied talents and abilities in singing, dancing and acting, and put up rousing and engaging performances for the students. It was indeed a memorable and fun-filled day for one and all, and we hope that students will savour these memories for many more years to come.
