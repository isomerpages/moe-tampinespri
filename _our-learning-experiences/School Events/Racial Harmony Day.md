It reflects how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to depict the unique cultural diversity that characterises Singapore life. The overall picture may change with time as our society evolves but the hues will continue to complement one another because of our long-shared history and heritage. This is Singapore’s bespoke approach towards multiculturalism and social cohesion, where the experiences of every individual matter and add to our diversity.</span><br></td>
