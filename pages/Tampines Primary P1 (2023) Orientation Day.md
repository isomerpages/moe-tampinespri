Tampines Primary P1 (2023) Orientation Day
==========================================

<b>1) Orientation Day Matters</b>

  

We are pleased to inform you that this year’s P1 Orientation will be held physically face to face after a 2-year hiatus. It will take place on Friday, 11 November 2022, at 2pm in the school hall. Registration starts from 1.30pm.

  

<b>Details of P1/2022 Orientation Day are as follows:</b>

Date:&nbsp;<b>11 November 2022, Friday</b>

Time:&nbsp;<b>2pm – 4pm</b>

Venue:&nbsp;<b>School Hall, Level 2</b>

<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;School books &amp; School uniforms for 2023 P1 students can be purchased on the same day. Sales will&nbsp;<u><b>strictly</b></u>&nbsp;commence after the end of Orientation Programme in the school hall.  

  

&nbsp;Entry is limited to 2 parents per child. We strongly encourage you to make alternate childcare arrangements should both parents wish to attend the Orientation Day.

<b>2) Approved COVID-19 guidelines for Public Sector Agencies</b>

  

In accordance with the latest approved COVID-19 guidelines for Public Sector Agencies, in the interest of public health, we take a targeted, risk-based approach in all school events.

  

a.  As the orientation is an event that involves parents, staff and students, in view of social consideration, we would like to strongly encourage all parents &amp; students to conduct an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) self-test before coming for the orientation. Please attend only if you test ART negative.

b.  For those who are exposed to higher risk personal circumstances, please ensure that you conduct ART self-testing and attend the orientation only if you test ART negative.&nbsp; Examples of these higher risk personal circumstances could include the following:

    i.  You have household contacts who are unwell with COVID-like symptoms.
    ii.  You are aware that you are in close contact with an infected person.

c.  If you feel unwell, you should go home immediately to rest or see a doctor.  
    

  

We thank you for helping us to keep Tampines Primary safe and healthy.

  

Best Regards
