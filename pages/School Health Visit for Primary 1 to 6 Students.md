Dear Parents and Guardians,

The Health Promotion Board (HPB) Youth Preventive Health Services (YPHS) will be conducting the annual school health screening visit in the school for Primary 1 to 6 students from&nbsp;<b>20 Apr 2023 to 3 May 2023</b>.

  

During this visit, age-appropriate health screening and/or immunisation services will be provided for your child as required. Kindly refer to the attachment, message from HPB on the detailed information on the health screening.

  

Only Primary 1 and 5 students are required to submit their Health Booklets to their respective Form Teachers on&nbsp;<b>Monday, 10 Apr 2023</b>.&nbsp; On the day of health screening, P1 &amp; P5 students (boys and girls) and P6 students (girls only) are to wear PE attire.

  

Parents are to access the Child Consent Portal (https://go.gov.sg/hpb-ccp) to update your child's medical information and provide consent for immunisation. Please note that immunisation will only be administered to your child if required.&nbsp;<i>No further action is needed if this has been previously submitted or if there is no update.</i>
