Dear Parents/Guardians,

The school has received feedback from the neighbourhood residents of cars parked illegally outside the school especially during dismissal.  As these cars have created traffic congestion and safety issues for the residents, they have also given similar feedback to LTA. 

The school would like to remind parents to use the nearby HDB carparks if they need to park and wait for their children. LTA officers will likely follow up on the feedback and will issue summonses to errant drivers who flout traffic rules.  We wish all families safe and happy commutes to and from school.

Thank you.
