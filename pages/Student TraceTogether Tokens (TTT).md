Student TraceTogether Tokens (TTT)
==================================

7 Jan 2022

  

Dear Parents/Guardians,

  

Please be informed that all contact tracing will be conducted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) through TTTs. If your child is a close contact, you will be informed by MOH and your child will be issued a Health Risk Warning (HRW).

  

Protocol 3 at https://www.covid.gov.sg/exposed/hrw

  

Students on HRW will have to self-isolate or submit the daily AG- test results before coming to school. Please contact your child’s form teacher if your child has been issued a HRW.

  

It is therefore important that all students have working TTTs. Students are expected to wear their TTTs when they are in school. Lanyards can be purchased from the school bookshop at $0.60. If the TTT is faulty or lost, please refer to https://token.gowhere.gov.sg/ for details on how to replace it.

Please write your child’s name and class on the TTT.

  

Thank you.

  

Tampines Primary School
