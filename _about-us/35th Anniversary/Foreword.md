Foreword
========

Tampines Primary School (TPPS) celebrated its 35th Anniversary in 2021. This special landing page on our school website captures the memories and well-wishes of Tampinesians past and present. We invite you to visit, read and find out more about TPPS.  
  
We are living in a period of profound change amidst a very stubborn global pandemic, altering the way we teach and learn.  
  
To deftly navigate we must be agile to adapt and rely on our community support network to ensure that TPPS remains a safe and happy school for all students, staff and stakeholders. To do that, we need one thing, that community spirit, that steadfastness, strength and togetherness- what we in Tampines Primary have in abundance. And that is what we hope our 35th Anniversary landing page is. It will be that place holding stories and memories that will give courage to our Tampinesians, past, present and future. The courage and perseverance as we move onward amidst these interesting times.  
  
We are also growing our website so as to serve you better. As we strive for our website to be a one stop portal to serve your needs, we welcome your feedback and suggestions too.  
  
As we embark on our journey ahead, 35 years and beyond, we hope you will continue to support us in what we do. We look forward to your partnership for many more years to come.
