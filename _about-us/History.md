History
=======

### **Origin**

Tampines, a thriving regional centre in the east of Singapore since the 1980s, has its name from the Tampines tree, a timber tree found in this area. Tampines wood is recognised for its strength, durability and resilience. An iconic primary school to represent the roots of this multi-ethnic neighbourhood of great vibrancy and prosperity was realized in 1985 when Tampines Primary School came into being.

  

Tampines Primary School started humbly in 1985 at Yumin Primary School and moved to its own premise at Tampines Street 12 in 1986 with a teaching staff of 42 and an enrollment of 1152 students in 29 classes.
