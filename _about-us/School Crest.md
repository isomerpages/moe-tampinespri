School Crest
============


<img src="/images/School%20Crest.png" style="width:80%">

The stylised typeface T and P stands for Tampines Primary School. It also signifies a child graduating from our school with an education towards the future incorporating IT.

  

The colours white, blue and red give a vivid identity of the school. The white background depicts the child's purity of mind. Blue depicts the hallmark of excellence where the sky is the limit.

  

Red represents the vibrancy of our school programmes.

  

The 2 lines represent the foundation steps towards achieving the desired outcomes of education and a bright future.

  

The round shape represents a holistic education for our students with the total involvement of the school and the community.
