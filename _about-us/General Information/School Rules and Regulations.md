### 4\. Attendance

Students must:

*   Be punctual at all times
*   Attend classes regularly
*   Seek permission before leaving the class or school
*   Submit medical certificates or parent’s letter (for compassionate reasons) when they are absent.

Students who are not present during the singing of National Anthem will be deemed as late.

  

### 5. Absence from School


Students are expected to be in school every school day. If a student is unable to come to school, parents/guardian are expected to notify the school. When a student is unwell, he/she should see a doctor and remain at home to recover. Any absence from school must be covered by a doctor’s medical certificate or a letter from the parent (for compassionate reasons). This should be handed to the Form Teacher when the student returns to school. 

  

However, if a student falls sick in school, the parents/guardian will be informed to bring him/her home. 

  

Parents should not take their child/children away from school for holidays before the end of the school terms.

  

### 6\. Early Departure

Students are not allowed to leave the school during the school hours unless parents or an adult authorised by the parents come personally and obtain permission. They are to sign out at the General Office when fetching the student home.


### 7\. Use of devices capable of capturing, storing, displaying and/or transmitting visual, audio and verbal information 


<i>Examples of such devices are: mobile phones, fitness trackers and smart wrist watches (including the POSB Smart Buddy)</i>

  

Students, with the permission of their parents, must submit a written request for the use of these devices within the school premises. A pass will be issued to the student when permission is granted. 

  

These devices can only be used within the school premises for emergency purposes. The devices should not be brought into examination rooms. Photography, video and voice recordings and gaming are prohibited within the school premises. Mobile phones must be switched off or put on silent mode at all times within the school premises.  

  

The student is solely responsible for their own devices. The school is not liable for any loss, theft or damage to the devices. Violation of the rules will result in withdrawal of permission and the devices will be kept by the school until a parent comes to claim it.


### 8. Safety of Students in School

For the safety of the students, visitors are not allowed into the school building without valid passes. All visitors are to report to the General Office. Parents who bring their children to school are to take them only as far as the gates. Every student should learn to be independent and to carry his/her own bag. 

  

Parents who drive their children to school in the morning may drive into the school compound and use the drop-off point. There is no parking or waiting within the school compound.

  

Parents will not be allowed into the school during the recess/lunch break.

  

### 9. Dismissal

Parents are to take note of the pick up points and dismissal times. They should be punctual. Cars can only enter the school compound after the departure of school buses. There is no waiting and parking of cars in the school. Parents waiting to fetch their children home should wait at the gates.

At Tampines Primary School, we believe that good discipline is important so that all students can learn in a warm and caring environment. Whilst the staff will try our best to instil self-discipline and desirable behaviour, we seek the co-operation of parents and caregivers to help reinforce good discipline. If students were to violate the school rules and need to be disciplined, the school seeks the support of parents so that the students can understand the consequences of their actions.
