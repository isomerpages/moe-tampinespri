<h3>5.&nbsp;Absence from School</h3>
<p>Students are expected to be in school every school day. If a student is

When a student is unwell, he/she should see a doctor and remain at home
to recover. Any absence from school must be covered by a doctor’s medical
certificate or a letter from the parent (for compassionate reasons). This
should be handed to the Form Teacher when the student returns to school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if a student falls sick in school, the parents/guardian will
be informed to bring him/her home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents should not take their child/children away from school for holidays
before the end of the school terms.</p>
<h3>6. Early Departure</h3>
<p>Students are not allowed to leave the school during the school hours unless
parents or an adult authorised by the parents come personally and obtain
permission. They are to sign out at the General Office when fetching the
student home.</p>
<h3>7. Use of devices capable of capturing, storing, displaying and/or transmitting visual, audio and verbal information&nbsp;</h3>
<p><em>Examples of such devices are: mobile phones, fitness trackers, smart watches (excluding the POSB Smart Buddy) and e-book readers.</em>
</p>
<p>Students are responsible for their own e-devices. All e-devices should
be put in the school bags except for the POSB Smart Buddy. The school is
not liable for any loss, theft or damage to the devices. All devices, if
used inappropriately, will be confiscated and be kept by the school until
a parent comes to claim it. Subsequently, students will not be allowed
to bring the devices to school.</p>
<p><u>Use of Mobile Phones and Smart Watches</u>
</p>
<p>Students are discouraged from bringing their handphones or wearing smart
watches to school. The use of mobile phones or smart watches for contacting
parents is only permitted outside school or at the school foyer after school
dismissal. These devices should not be brought into the examination rooms.
Photography, video and voice recordings and gaming are prohibited within
the school premises.</p>
<p>Handphones must be switched off at all times within the school premises.
For smart watches, the communication capabilities must be disabled. Examples

</table>
<p>At Tampines Primary School, we believe that good discipline is important
so that all students can learn in a warm and caring environment. Whilst
the staff will try our best to instil self-discipline and desirable behaviour,
we seek the co-operation of parents and caregivers to help reinforce good
discipline. If students were to violate the school rules and need to be
disciplined, the school seeks the support of parents so that the students
can understand the consequences of their actions.&nbsp;</p>
