\*\* Students will have a break from 2 p.m. â€“ 2.30 p.m. if they have lesson/remedial after 2 p.m.

  

There will be a 10-min snack break for students at 9.30 a.m. or 12.30 p.m. Students can bring snacks to eat in class. In line with healthy living, we hope that parents can prepare healthy snacks for students. The snack should be a healthier food option and should be easy for the child to manage. During the snack break, students are not allowed to go to the canteen to purchase food. Students can purchase the snacks from the school canteen before school starts for their snack break. Parents will need to provide their child with a pack of wet wipes to clean up after the snack break.

  

The table below indicates healthy snack food that are acceptable and those that are not acceptable.

### **Precautionary Measures to Ensure Safety Measures Management**

Parents/Caregivers are to wait for their children outside the school at dismissal. Driving parents/caregivers are reminded that there is no waiting or parking in the school carpark. For CCA, Enrichment, Remedial or Supplementary dismissals, cars will only enter the school strictly at the dismissal times given. If you are early, please be advised to wait at the public carparks near the school.

  

Thank you for your understanding.
