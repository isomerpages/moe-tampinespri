Principal’s Message
===================

Welcome to Tampines Primary School Website

Our theme is to ‘Know Every Child and Grow Every Child’.

It fittingly encapsulates our aspiration to help every Tampinesian learn, grow and excel.

Since our official founding in 1986 as the first community school in Singapore, we have grown together with the community to become a school of excellence in nurturing life-long learners of good character.

The school has accredited curricular and non-curricular programmes to ensure that each child is advocated for, holistically developed and meaningfully engaged. The school has two recognized signature programmes. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP), ‘ACTitude’ ensures that students learn confidence, creativity, communication skills and values through drama. The new Learning for Life Programme (LLP), ‘Future Ready Citizens – Developing the Community Leader’ aims to develop all students into leaders who will be able to look beyond self to serve others. Using servant leadership principles, our students will appreciate the importance of empathy, care and gratitude. They will be given opportunities to practice these in their interactions.&nbsp; Underpinning all these are the refreshed school values of iREAP - integrity, respect, excellence, adaptability and passion.

The MOE Kindergarten at Tampines Primary is now fully functioning with K1 and K2 students.&nbsp;

Despite the many challenges posed by COVID-19, the staff have been able to actively partner parents and help the students to continue with their learning, blending face-to-face interactions with on-line programmes.&nbsp; The good enrolment figures and the keen interest from parents for both the primary and kindergarten sections show the trust that parents have in the school, making us a school of choice.

My staff and I look forward to 2023, to you joining us in the journey, to realise our vision of “A Community School of Excellence, Caring Hearts and Creative Minds”.
