<h1>Principal’s Message</h1>
<p>Welcome to Tampines Primary School Website</p>
<p>As we embark on another exciting academic year in 2026, I am happy to
share that our vision 'A community school of excellence: Care Create Connect
Contribute' drives everything that we do at TPPS. The first community school
in Singapore, we aspire for our children to Care for one another and others
who are less fortunate than themselves, Create new solutions to tomorrow’s
problems and carve their own path for success, Connect with the community
and the world around them and Contribute to making a difference in the
lives of others.</p>
<p>In our attempt to achieve the above, the staff and I are committed to
Know Every Child, Grow Every Child and Celebrate Every Child in a safe
and happy environment where every child looks forward to coming to school
to learn and develop. We believe that every child has interest and unique
talents. AT TPPS, we will help our children discover their passion and
hone their talents through the holistic programmes that we offer.</p>
<p>To help our students navigate the challenges in the 21st century, we imbue
in our students our iREAP values of Integrity, Resilience, Excellence,
Adaptability, and Passion. We believe that these are the values that will
stand them in good stead in the future. As a rallying call, our motto 'To
Persevere And Succeed' reminds our students that with determination and
sheer hard work, every one of them can achieve their goals and dreams.</p>
<p>It leaves me now to invite you to join me in shaping the next generation.
Together, let's make Tampines Primary School a place where every child
thrives!</p>
