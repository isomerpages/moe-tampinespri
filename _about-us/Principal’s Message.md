The school has two recognized signature programmes. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP), ‘ACTitude’ ensures that students learn confidence, creativity, communication skills and values through drama. The new Learning for Life Programme (LLP), ‘Future Ready Citizens – Developing the Community Leader’ aims to develop all students into leaders who will be able to look beyond self to serve others. Using servant leadership principles, our students will appreciate the importance of empathy, care and gratitude. They will be given opportunities to practice these in their interactions.&nbsp; Underpinning all these are the refreshed school values of iREAP - integrity, respect, excellence, adaptability and passion.</p><p>The MOE Kindergarten at Tampines Primary is now fully functioning with K1 and K2 students.&nbsp; Many of the kindergarteners utilize their accorded priority at official P1 registration exercise to join Tampines Primary School.</p><p>The good enrolment figures and the keen interest from parents for both the primary and kindergarten sections show the trust that parents have in the school, making us a school of choice.</p><p>My staff and I look forward to 2024, to you joining us in the journey, to realise our vision of “A Community School of Excellence: Caring, Creating, Connecting and Contributing”.</p><p>Mrs Lay See Neufeld<br>Principal<br>Tampines Primary School</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/principal_photo_2024.jpg"></div><p></p><p><a href="/files/straits_time_article_p1_2023-06-27.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Straits Times Article - Preparing Children for P1 ( 27-06-2023)</a><br><em>The article was published on Straits Times website on 27th June 2023</em></p>
