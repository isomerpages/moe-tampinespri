<h1>Principal’s Message</h1>
<p>Welcome to Tampines Primary School Website</p>
<p>Our mission to #knoweverychild, #groweverychild and #celebrate every child
has guided us in the planning and delivery of all school efforts. It fittingly
encapsulates our aspiration to help and empower every Tampinesian learn,
grow and excel. Our staff are fully committed to work in partnership with
parents, stakeholders and the community to unlock the unique potential
in each student.</p>
<p>Since our official founding in 1986 as the first community school in Singapore,
we have grown together with the community to become a school of excellence
in nurturing life-long learners of good character.</p>
<p>The school has accredited curricular and non-curricular programmes to
ensure that each child is advocated for, holistically developed and meaningfully
engaged. The school has two recognized signature programmes. The Applied
Learning Programme (ALP), ‘ACTitude’ ensures that students learn confidence,
creativity, communication skills and values through drama. The new Learning
for Life Programme (LLP), ‘Future Ready Citizens – Developing the Community
Leader’ aims to develop all students into leaders who will be able to look
beyond self to serve others. Using servant leadership principles, our students
will appreciate the importance of empathy, care and gratitude. Underpinning
all these are the refreshed school values of iREAP - integrity, resilience,
excellence, adaptability and passion. Students are strongly encouraged
and given opportunities to put these values into practice both in school
and at home.</p>
<p>The MOE Kindergarten at Tampines Primary is now fully functioning with
K1 and K2 students. Many of the kindergarteners utilize their accorded
priority at official P1 registration exercise to join Tampines Primary
School.</p>
<p>The good enrolment figures and the keen interest from parents for both
the primary and kindergarten sections show the trust that parents have
in the school, making us a school of choice.</p>
<p>Part of our school’s improvement plans include completing a covered court
and air conditioning in the school hall. These will help us to make Tampines
Primary a more conducive place for learning and teaching.</p>
<p>My staff and I look forward to 2025, to you joining us in the journey,
to realise our vision of “A Community School of Excellence: Caring, Creating,
Connecting and Contributing”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Lay See Neufeld
<br>Principal
<br>Tampines Primary School</p>
