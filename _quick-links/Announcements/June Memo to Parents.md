June Memo to Parents
====================

24 Jun 2022

  

Dear Parents/Guardians,

  

Welcome back to school! Term 3 promises to be an active and engaging one for all students. With the easing of the national safe management measures, the students will be able to enjoy more face-to-face programmes both in school and externally.

  

Please see June Memo for details.

Thank you.
