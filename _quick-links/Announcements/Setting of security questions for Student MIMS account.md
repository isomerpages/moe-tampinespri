<h2><strong>Setting of security questions for Student MIMS account</strong></h2>
<p>TPPS/ICT/02/2025</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Your child’s/ward's MIMS (MOE Identity Management System) account provides
access to important platforms such as Student iCON and the Student Learning
Space. If your child/ward forgets their MIMS password, they will not be
able to log in to these accounts.</p>
<p>Currently, to reset the password, your child/ward needs to seek assistance
from the school’s MIMS Student Administrator. However, this process may
take some time and is not immediate.</p>
<p>The MIMS Student Self-Service Password Reset Service allows students to
reset their passwords on their own if they forget them. We encourage you
to use the attached guide to help your child/ward in setting up this service
so they can regain access to their accounts quickly when needed, by <strong>4 April 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Mdm Dianna</p>
<p>HOD ICT</p>
