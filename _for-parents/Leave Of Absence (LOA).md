Leave Of Absence (LOA)
======================

The LOA scheme allows Singaporean/ PR to rejoin their school after they return from overseas.  

  

If LOA is granted, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

  

Applicants are to submit the completed [LOA application form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/60cbef68fc19080012dc3544) and the LOA fees to the school.

  

For more information, please refer to [MOE’s website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans).
