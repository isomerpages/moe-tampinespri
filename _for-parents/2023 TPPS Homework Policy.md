<u><b>RE: Homework Policy</b></u>

Dear Parents and Guardians,

I would like to share Tampines Primary’s homework policy so that we can work together to ensure that your child is clear about the work that needs to be done and how (s)he can best be supported.

<u>Why is Homework Important?</u>

Homework has immediate as well as long-term benefits for students.

<u>Immediate Benefits</u>

Students will

*   have opportunity to practise the skills taught
*   be able to process the information learnt
*   be encouraged to learn outside the classroom

resulting in overall better understanding of learning and mastery of skills.&nbsp;Long Term Benefits&nbsp;Students will

*   practise self-discipline and time management
*   be more inquisitive
*   be more independent
*   be better problem solvers

resulting in forming good study habits as well as improving their attitude towards school.

<u>Parents’ Role</u>

Parents are important partners in their children’s education. Since there is a clear link between good homework performance and overall student performance, parents play a critical part in ensuring successful completion of students’ homework. Parents can do the following to help their children:

*   spend time to talk about their daily school activities/experiences
*   assist them to establish a good pattern of study
*   guide them to set aside a regular study time
*   have a study area away from household distraction(s)

<u>Students’ Role</u>

To ensure effectiveness of homework, students should do the following:

*   have a home study timetable
*   have sufficient study materials to do their homework
*   organise their school materials: study notes, assignments, books, papers, etc
*   make sure they understand all the given assignments
*   ask questions, if necessary
*   seek help from classmates, friends or teachers if they face any difficulty.

<u><b>General Guidelines on Homework</b></u>

<u>Primary 1 and 2</u>  
Daily reading for enjoyment  
Either English Language, Mathematics and/or Mother Tongue Language homework  
About 0.5 to 1 hour in total every weekday

<u>Primary 3 and 4</u>  
Daily reading for enjoyment  
English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Language homework  
About 1 to 1.5 hours in total every weekday

<u>Primary 5 and 6</u>  
English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Language homework  
About 1.5 to 2 hours in total every weekday

<u>Primary 5 and 6 Foundation</u>  
Foundation English Language, Foundation Mathematics, Foundation Science and Foundation Mother Tongue Language homework  
About 1 to 1.5 hours in total every weekday.

<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;P6 students may have more homework as they progress towards PSLE.

Students who are unable to finish the work set in class will also need to complete it at home. They may also do corrections as part of their homework. In addition, teachers may ask the students to do some journal writing, reading (fiction and non-fiction), Music and Art. In the course of the year, students may also need to do some research as part of their homework for their group/class projects. There may be some homework set over the weekends and school holidays depending on the needs of the class.

These are general guidelines for reference and may be differentiated to meet the needs and interests of different students.

In 2023, for classes with spelling, Mother Tongue spelling will be conducted on Wednesdays (P3 &amp; P4) or Thursdays (P1, P2, P5 &amp; P6) and English spelling will be on any of the other weekdays. If there is a public or school holiday, spelling will be postponed to the next school day. Homework to be given for the day will be clearly written on the class whiteboards. Teachers will remind students to note the homework in their diaries.

Teachers will not be setting assessment practice for the students on a regular basis. Assessment practice is only useful when students are going to sit for coming examinations. The aim of learning and homework extends beyond examination practice. If there is any need for tests, these will be spaced out and be set on different days. Please help your child by making sure that homework is done before tuition work. If you want your child to learn, do not do the work for him/her. Help us to guide your child to good study habits.

It is useful and important for all parents to ensure that their children check their student diaries daily so as to be updated regarding school matters or homework set. Children sometimes take a long time over their homework not because of a lack of understanding but because they are not able to be focused and disciplined.

With close partnership between school and home, students will learn to note down work that needs to be done and learn the life-skill of being self-disciplined regarding work. We look forward to a meaningful year, working hand-in-hand with you to nurture our students’ potential.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs Lay See Neufeld  
Principal
