The Parent Support Group (PSG) was incepted in 1999. The school recognises that there are parents who are able to volunteer their time and services to help out with school programmes and activities. The PSG EXCO was nominated by the Principal. Each PSG director is involved in different school programmes and activities under the various strategic thrusts.

The PSG members are engaged in school life and in dialogue first through recruitment. At PSG meetings, members share the ways they can contribute to the school and pupils and the school shares with members the school’s philosophy and directions and areas in which PSG members can contribute. In addition, the school also conducts meetings with the PSG to get updates on the group’s activities and to engage members in dialogue about parents’ needs and expectations. Through these meetings, the school leader gathers feedback about school directions, programmes and operations and suggestions for improvement. Examples of suggestions that have been taken up are issuing fewer homework assignments during festive seasons and safety measures to further ensure pupil’s safety.
