Parent Support Group
====================

Since its inception in 1999, the Parent Support Group (PSG) has provided opportunities for parents to connect with each other and the school. The PSG team works closely with the school to support school programmes and propose initiatives that benefit the TPPS community.

PSG members can contribute by volunteering in weekly programmes, recess activities and learning journeys. They can also participate in parent-child bonding activities organised by the PSG.

Join as a PSG member and get involved by completing the Parent Support Group application form by scanning the QR code below or clicking on it to follow the link. We look forward to welcoming you to the Parent Support Group!
