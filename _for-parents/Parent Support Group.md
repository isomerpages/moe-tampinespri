<h1>Parent Support Group</h1>
<p>Since its inception in 1999, the Parent Support Group (PSG) has provided
opportunities for parents to connect with each other and the school. The
PSG team works closely with the school to support school programmes and
propose initiatives that benefit the TPPS community.</p>
<p>PSG members can contribute by volunteering in weekly programmes, recess
activities and learning journeys. They can also participate in parent-child
bonding activities organised by the PSG.</p>
<p>Join as a PSG member and get involved by completing the Parent Support
Group application form by scanning the QR code or clicking on the link
below. We look forward to welcoming you to the Parent Support Group!</p>
