<h2><strong>2024 Homework Policy</strong></h2>
<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share Tampines Primary’s homework policy so that we can
work together to ensure that your child is clear about the work that needs
to be done and how (s)he can be best supported.</p>
<p><u>Why is homework important</u>?</p>
<p>Homework has immediate as well as long-term benefits for students.</p>
<p><u>Immediate Benefits</u>
</p>
<p>Students will</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>have opportunity to practise the skills taught</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be able to process the information learnt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be encouraged to learn outside the classroom</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>resulting in overall better understanding of learning and mastery of skills.</p>
<p><u>Long-Term Benefits</u>
</p>
<p>Students will</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>practise self-discipline and time management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be more inquisitive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be more independent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be better problem solvers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>resulting in the formation of good study habits as well as improving their
attitude towards school.</p>
<p><u>Parents’ Role</u>
</p>
<p>Parents are important partners in their children’s education. Since there
is a clear link between good homework performance and overall student performance,
parents play a critical part in ensuring successful completion of students’
homework.&nbsp; Parents can do the following to help their children:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>spend time to talk about their daily school activities/experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assist them in establishing a good pattern of study</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guide them to set aside a regular study time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a study area away from household distraction(s)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Students’ Role</u>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;To ensure effectiveness of homework, students should do the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>have a home study timetable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have sufficient study materials to do their homework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organise their school materials: study notes, assignments, books, papers,
etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure they understand all the given assignments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask questions, if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seek help from classmates, friends or teachers if they face any difficulty.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: P6 students may have more homework as they progress towards PSLE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students who are unable to finish the work set in class will also
need to complete it at home.&nbsp; They may also do corrections as part
of their homework. In addition, teachers may ask the students to do some
journal writing, reading (fiction and non-fiction), Music and Art. In the
course of the year, students may also need to do some research as part
of their homework for their group/class projects. There may be some homework
set over the weekends and school holidays depending on the needs of the
class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are general guidelines for reference and may be differentiated
to meet the needs and interests of different students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2024, for classes with spelling, Mother Tongue spelling will
be conducted on Wednesdays (P3 &amp; P4) or Thursdays (P1, P2, P5 &amp;
P6) and English spelling will be on any of the other weekdays. If there
is a public or school holiday, spelling will be postponed to the next school
day. Homework to be given for the day will be clearly written on the class
whiteboards. Teachers will remind students to note the homework in their
diaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Teachers will <u>not</u> be setting assessment practice for the students
on a regular basis.&nbsp; Assessment practice is only useful when students
are going to sit for coming examinations. The aim of learning and homework
extends beyond examination practice. If there is any need for tests, these
will be spaced out and be set on different days. Please help your child
by making sure that homework is done before tuition work. If you want your
child to learn, do not do the work for him/her. Help us to guide your child
to good study habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is useful and important for all parents to ensure that their
children check their student diaries daily so as to be updated regarding
school matters or homework set. Children sometimes take a long time over
their homework not because of a lack of understanding but because they
are unable to remain focused and disciplined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;With close partnership between school and home, students will learn
to note down work that needs to be done and learn the life-skill of being
self-disciplined regarding work. We look forward to a meaningful year,
working hand-in-hand with you to nurture our students’ potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yours in partnership,</p>
