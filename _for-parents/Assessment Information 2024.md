<h1>Assessment Information 2024</h1>
<p>16 February 2024</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>In Tampines Primary School, assessments serve as important milestones
for our students. It provides an opportunity for students to revise, consolidate
and apply their understanding in a formal setting. It also provides students
with feedback to address and bridge their learning gaps.</p>
<p>We would like to share Tampines Primary’s Assessment Information so that
we can work together to develop an assessment culture that builds intrinsic
motivation in our students to learn within a safe environment.</p>
<p>We seek parents’/guardians’ support to go through the Assessment Information
(kindly refer to Annexes 1 and 2) with your child(ren). Form teachers will
also be briefing the students on the contents of the assessment information.
The information is correct at the time of print. Should there be any changes
to the information, you will be duly informed.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
<br>Mrs Lay See Neufeld
<br>Principal</p>
