Assessment Information 2023
===========================

30 January 2023

Dear Parents/Guardians,

In Tampines Primary School, assessments serve as important milestones for our students. It provides an opportunity for students to revise, consolidate and apply their understanding in a formal setting. It also provides students with feedback to address and bridge their learning gaps.

We would like to share Tampines Primary’s Assessment Information so that we can work together to develop an assessment culture that builds intrinsic motivation in our students to learn within a safe environment. From this year onwards, all Mid-Year Examinations (MYE) will be removed. It is aimed at freeing up curriculum time to pace out learning and better support the use of more varied learning activities across the different levels.

We seek parents’/guardians’ support to go through the Assessment Information (kindly refer to Annexes 1 &amp; 2) with your child(ren). Form teachers will also be briefing the students on the contents of the assessment information. The information is correct at the time of print. Should there be any changes to the information, you will be duly informed.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,  
Mrs Lay See Neufeld  
Principal
