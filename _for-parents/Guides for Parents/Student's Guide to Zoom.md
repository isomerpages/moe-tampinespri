Student's Guide to Zoom
=======================

  

Dear Parents,

  

Please refer to the Studentâ€™s Guide to Video Conferencing with Teachers using Zoom for Home-based Learning.

  

Teachers may use the video conferencing platform to engage your child/ward in online interactive lessons. Your child/ward will be informed prior to the Zoom lesson.

  

The guide is also available on Parents Gateway.

  

Thank you.
