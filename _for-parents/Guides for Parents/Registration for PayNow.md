<h1>Registration for PayNow</h1>
<p>22 Nov 2020</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>With the increasing digitalisation of government services, MOE would like
to encourage all parents to register their children’s bank account with
PayNow using the children’s BC/NRIC number. The activation of PayNow will
facilitate the prompt disbursement of monies for the child, and avoid delays
through the filling in and processing of forms or from physical visits
to banks for the deposit of cheques. For a start, MOE will be using PayNow
(BC/NRIC) as a means to disburse Edusave award monies starting from the
upcoming Edusave award exercise in Dec 2020.</p>
<p>To register for PayNow for your children with their BC/NRIC number, you
can refer to the attached guide on PayNow or visit the website of the Association
of Banks in Singapore (link provided) for more information. Please approach
your bank if you need further assistance to register for PayNow for your
children.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
