Positive Parenting Program® (Triple P)
======================================

  

Methodist Welfare Services Family Support Programme (MWS FSP) has been appointed by Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to partner with Tampines Primary School, to conduct Positive Parenting Program® (Triple P).

  

Triple P has helped parents build stronger relationships with their children. This programme was developed by clinical psychologist Prof Matt Sanders at the University of Queensland, with more than 40 years of ongoing research.
