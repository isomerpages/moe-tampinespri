Education And Career Guidance (ECG) Portal
==========================================

23 Sep 2020   
  
The ECG program from the MySkillsFuture student portal gives an opportunity to equip your child/ward to make informed decisions regarding his/her post primary education.   
  
The activities in the portal are meant for your child to explore and think and be curious about their interests, abilities and passion. You and your child can log-on to the MySkillsfuture Student Portal to continue their journey and discover more.   
  
Please see attached letter for details.   
  
Thank you.
