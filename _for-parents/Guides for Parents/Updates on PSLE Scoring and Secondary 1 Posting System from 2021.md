Updates on PSLE Scoring and Secondary 1 Posting System from 2021
================================================================

9 Nov 2020  
  
Dear Parents/Guardians,&nbsp;  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To support you and your child in understanding the new PSLE scoring system that will be implemented next year, MOE has shared more information on:&nbsp;  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I. Indicative Achievement Level (AL) Cut-Off Point (COP) ranges for different secondary school types; and&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;II. Subject-Based Banding (SBB) eligibility criteria under the AL scoring system.&nbsp;  
  
The attached infographic provides a summary of the announcement. For more information, please visit MOE’s PSLE microsite (refer to the link included).&nbsp;  
  
In addition, MOE will be organising a webinar on “Preparing Your Child’s Transition to Secondary Education” on 5 Dec (Sat), 10am to 12noon. This session aims to familiarise parents of Primary 5 children with the new PSLE scoring and Secondary 1 posting system, and how they can support their children in the transition to secondary school. You may sign up via the link provided. Successful registrants will receive a confirmation email.&nbsp;  
  
Thank you.&nbsp;
