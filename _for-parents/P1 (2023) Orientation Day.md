#### **2) Approved COVID-19 guidelines for Public Sector Agencies**  

In accordance with the latest approved COVID-19 guidelines for Public Sector Agencies, in the interest of public health, we take a targeted, risk-based approach in all school events.

a.  As the orientation is an event that involves parents, staff and students, in view of social consideration, we would like to strongly encourage all parents and students to conduct an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) self-test before coming for the orientation. Please attend only if you test ART negative.

b.  For those who are exposed to higher risk personal circumstances, please ensure that you conduct ART self-testing and attend the orientation only if you test ART negative. Examples of these higher risk personal circumstances could include the following:

	i.  You have household contacts who are unwell with COVID-like symptoms.
	ii.  You are aware that you are in close contact with an infected person.

c.  If you feel unwell, you should go home immediately to rest or see a doctor.

We thank you for helping us to keep Tampines Primary School safe and healthy.
