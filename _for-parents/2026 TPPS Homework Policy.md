<h2><strong>2026 Homework Policy</strong></h2>
<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share Tampines Primary’s homework policy so that we can
work together to ensure that your child is clear about the work that needs
to be done and how (s)he can be best supported. Together, we can help every
child to succeed.</p>
<p><u>Why is homework important?</u><br>
Homework can reinforce students’ learning, deepen understanding of lessons
taught and allow them to regularly practise and apply skills and concepts
taught. It also enables students to cultivate good study habits and positive
work ethics through practising self-discipline and time management. At
the same time, homework allows teachers to check for pupils’ understanding
and progress, so as to provide timely feedback, intervention and support.</p>
Homework assignments may include:
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
Practice exercises to follow classroom instruction
</li>
<li>
Preview assignments to prepare for subsequent lessons
</li>
<li>
Extension assignments to transfer new skills or concepts to new situations
</li>
<li>
Creative activities to integrate many skills toward the production of a response or product
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Parents’ Role</u>
<br>
Homework provides parents with timely information on the learning progress of their child and the opportunity to be involved in their child’s learning.
Parents should work hand-in-hand with the teachers in supporting their children in their learning by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
spending time to talk about their daily school activities/experiences
</li>
<li>
assisting them in establishing a good pattern of study
</li>
<li>
guiding them to set aside a regular study time
</li>
<li>
having a study area away from household distraction(s)
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Students’ Role</u>
<br>
To ensure effectiveness of homework, students should do the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
record homework given in the student diary
</li>
<li>
ask questions to clarify if they are unclear with assignment instructions
</li>
<li>
have a home study timetable
</li>
<li>
organise their school materials: study notes, assignments, books, papers,
etc.
</li>
<li>
seek help from classmates, friends or teachers if they face any difficulty
</li>
<li>
take pride in their assignments and produce quality work
</li>
<li>
ensure assignments, including corrections are completed on time
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Guidelines on Homework</strong>
<br>
While homework is important for students, we are cognizant that there is a need to balance between time spent on homework as well as other activities such as social interaction and sleep. Hence, we will ensure that assignments are given regularly without overloading pupils unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Note:<br>
	*P1 students can expect homework only from T2 onwards
<br>**P6 students may have more homework as they progress towards PSLE.</p>
<p>Students who are unable to finish the work set in class will also need
to complete it at home. They may also do corrections as part of their homework.
In addition, teachers may ask the students to do some journal writing,
reading (fiction and non-fiction), Music and Art. In the course of the
year, students may also need to do some research as part of their homework
for their group/class projects. There may be some homework set over the
weekends and school holidays depending on the needs of the class.</p>
<p>These are general guidelines for reference and may be differentiated to
meet the needs and interests of different students.</p>
<p>Homework to be given for the day will be clearly written on the class
whiteboards. Teachers will remind students to note the homework in their
diaries.</p>
<p>Please help your child by making sure that homework is done before the
deadline. If you want your child to learn, do not do the work for him/her.
Help us to guide your child to good study habits.</p>
<p>It is useful and important for all parents to ensure that their children
check their student diaries daily to be updated regarding school matters
or homework set. Children sometimes take a long time over their homework
not because of a lack of understanding but because they are unable to remain
focused and disciplined.</p>
<p>With close partnership between school and home, students will learn to
note down work that needs to be done and learn the life-skill of being
self-disciplined regarding work. We look forward to a meaningful year,
working together with you to nurture our students’ potential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours in partnership,<br>
Mr Hanafi Asmore<br>
Principal</p>
