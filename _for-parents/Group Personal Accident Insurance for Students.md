Group Personal Accident Insurance for Students
==============================================

11 Jan 2023

  

 Dear Parents and Guardians,

  

MOE has purchased the Group Personal Accident Insurance from Income Insurance Limited for all students for 2023. This is a basic accident insurance plan.  Do refer to the Product Fact Sheet (link available below) for the details of the Group Personal Accident Insurance for students.

  

Please note:  

  

1.    This is a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance which covers death, permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses due to an accident. The proximate or triggering causes of injuries must be reasonably attributed to an accident. <br>
<b>Parents/guardians will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before submitting claims to Income for reimbursement. Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardian.</b> <br>
<b>Parents/guardians should also take note that medical treatments at private hospitals will typically cost higher, and parents/guardian may need to pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policy’s coverage limits.</b> 

  

2. <u>Outpatient Medical Expenses (for medical expenses incurred up to 365 days from date of accident)</u> <br>
Up to $2150 with $400 sub-limit for treatment by TCM practitioners  

  

 3. <u>What is NOT covered?</u> <br>
			a) Treatment incurred more than 365 days from date of accident. <br>                       b) Treatment for an injury not as a result of an accident. <br>
			c) Private physiotherapy or alternative treatment (treatment such as herbalist, Podiatrist, Naturopathy, Ayurveda). <br>d) Non-prescribed medication or mobility aids (such as crutches, wheelchair, etc).
			
			
4. <u>Claim Procedures</u> <br>
All claims should be submitted via Income’s GPA portal at https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg as soon as possible <u><b>by parents</b></u> subjected to a cap of 365 days from the date of accident. A confirmation email will be sent to parents.
