<h1>Group Personal Accident Insurance for Students</h1>
<p>11 Jan 2023</p>
<p>&nbsp;Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>MOE has purchased the Group Personal Accident Insurance from Income Insurance
Limited for all students for 2023. This is a basic accident insurance plan.&nbsp;
Do refer to the Product Fact Sheet (link available below) for the details
of the Group Personal Accident Insurance for students.</p>
<p>Please note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance which
covers death, permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses
due to an accident. The proximate or triggering causes of injuries must
be reasonably attributed to an accident.
<br><strong>Parents/guardians will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before submitting claims to Income for reimbursement. Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardian.</strong> 
<br><strong>Parents/guardians should also take note that medical treatments at private hospitals will typically cost higher, and parents/guardian may need to pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policy’s coverage limits.</strong>
</p>

<br>Up to $2150 with $400 sub-limit for treatment by TCM practitioners</p>
