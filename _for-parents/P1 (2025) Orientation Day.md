P1 (2025) Orientation Day
=======================

Dear Parents,

As the National-wide P1 Registration period is still ongoing and is expected to end on 30 August 2024, the school will not be able to provide much information on the P1 Orientation/Admin Day for the time being. 

All information related to the Orientation/Admin Day will be disseminated in stages to all parents via email (postman.gov.sg) provided during P1 registration period. Information will include (School Books / School Uniform / School Bus Services / School Student Care Services, etc).

P1 Orientation/Admin Day will be on Friday, 8 November 2024, afternoon. Exact timing will be revealed at a later time. Parents and incoming P1 child are strongly encouraged to attend the Orientation Day to prepare your child for Day 1 of 2025 school curriculum. 

Thank you.
