<h3><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h3>
<p>1.Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand
    the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
    mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
    members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
    on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
    the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
    marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
    The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
    beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
    on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.The Goals of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>a. To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
    the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate knowledge on human
    sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p>b. To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
    through the acquisition of social and emotional skills of self-awareness,
    management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
    for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
    decision-making skills; and</p>
<p>c. To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and
    for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of
    society, through the inculcation of positive mainstream values and attitudes
    about sexuality.</p>
<p>3.The Key Messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>a. Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>b. Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
    foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>c. Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>d. Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
    and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
    ones.</p>

        in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>Note: Scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum page not found.</p>
<p>5.The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a. Science</p>
<p>b. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6.The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
    and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
    and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
    in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
    ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
    cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. “Curious
    Minds” is a response to these challenges.</p>
<p>7.The Primary 5 &amp; 6 Growing Years (GY) package, “Curious Minds (2nd
    Edition)”, aims to meet students’ developmental needs, give emphasis to
    the teaching of skills and values, and focus on helping students navigate
    changes, build healthy relationships, especially online relationships,
    and exercise safety.</p>
<p><strong>At Tampines Primary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2024::</strong>
