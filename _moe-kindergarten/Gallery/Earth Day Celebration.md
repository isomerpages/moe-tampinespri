Earth Day Celebration
=====================

The children were taught the value of saving the Earth by reducing the usage of electricity, water, etc. They switched off the lights for an hour in the classroom to save electricity. In addition, each class was given a bottle of 1.5 liters of water for them to wash their hands. Thirdly, each child made his/her own Earth promises on the given piece of paper.
