Hari Raya Celebration
=====================

We had a joyous Hari Raya celebration at MK@TPPS this year. Our children watched a compilation of Hari Raya preparation videos followed by a recorded Malay dance performance video done by the Malay children. After that, K1 children made Ketupat crafts and K2 children made Crescent and Moon mobile crafts. Dressed in traditional costumes, children enjoyed the traditional malay kuih during the snack time.
