Chinese New Year Celebration 2022
=================================

We had a joyous Chinese New Year celebration at MK@TPPS this year. Our children watched a Live Zoom Session in English and Mandarin, and they did a Tiger craft to usher in the Year of the Tiger. They also peeled mandarin oranges, and used the skin to form prosperous words –  “吉” (Luck) and “春” (Spring). Dressed in traditional costumes, children brought two mandarin oranges to wish their teachers and friends a Happy Chinese New Year.
