MOE Kindergarten @ Tampines Primary (MK@TPPS) received our first batch of Kindergarten 1 students in January 2021. 

  

At MK@TPPS, we are all about C.A.R.E. – Courage, Ardour, Respect and Empathy. We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey at MK@TPPS through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Bilingual Literacy Programme for English Language (EL) and Mother Tongue Languages (MTL).  

  

MK@TPPS also provides Kindergarten Care (KCare) service for students enrolled in our MK.
