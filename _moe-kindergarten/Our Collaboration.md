Our Collaboration
========================
**Close collaboration with primary schools to facilitate transition to P1.** <br>
We have close collaboration with primary school to facilitate transition to P1.  K2 children will engage in various activities to familiarize themselves with primary school environment and routines.  They also have opportunities to interact with primary school students.

**Strong partnerships with families and the community to enrich children’s learning experiences.** <br>
We believe parents can be our strong partners in enriching children’s learning experiences.  At times, we invite parents to conduct some activities along with the class teachers.  For events, we get parents to volunteer in helping with preparations as well as the event organization. Besides, we also communicate with parents frequently via different platforms and channels so that parents are updated with their children’s activities in school.  In addition, we invite parents to participate in fun activities with their children!
