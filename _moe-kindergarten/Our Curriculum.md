### Little Artist Programme
The "Little Artist Programme" is a unique and enriching initiative at our centre designed to foster creativity and artistic expression in young children. Every term, our little learners explore a variety of artistic materials and techniques, each inspired by artists from around the world. Through hands-on activities, they delve into the styles and methods of these artists, creating their own imaginative interpretations and original pieces of art.

As part of the programme, children have the opportunity to experiment with different mediums such as paint, leaves, sticks, bottle caps, and more. Each project is carefully crafted to be age-appropriate and engaging, encouraging children to express themselves freely and develop their artistic skills.

To celebrate their creativity and hard work, the children's completed artworks, along with photographs capturing their creative processes, are proudly displayed along the staircases leading to their classrooms. This vibrant gallery not only showcases the children's artistic journeys but also transforms our school environment into an inspiring and colorful space for all to enjoy. The "Little Artist Programme" aims to instill a lifelong love for art in our young students and to recognize the value of their unique artistic voices.
